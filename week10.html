## Motivations for Text Encoding
- Access &amp; preservation
- Discovery &amp; dissemination
- Searching/browsing
- Interoperability &amp; portability
- Analysis 
- Visualization
---
## Representing the Text with Encoding
- Structural markup
	- headings, sections, paragraphs, stanzas, lines
- Descriptive markup
	- metadata 
		- title, author, publisher, date
	- content description
		- names, places, quotations, figures of speech, titles, dates
---
## Interpretive text encoding
Much text encoding is not objective data entry. Text encoding can be subjective, interpretive, critical.

Literary scholar Jerome J. McGann has written, 

> When you mark up [i.e., encode] a text you are ipso facto reading and interpreting it. A … text marked up in TEI has been subjected to a certain kind of interpretation. 
>
> —McGann, _Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide Web_ (New York: Palgrave, 2001), p. 143.

## Project-specific guidelines
In text encoding, and particularly, with TEI, there are often many options for encoding a particular textual phenomenon, and so most projects have project-specific guidelines, to supplement the more general TEI Guidelines.

## Quick introduction to XML
XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a non-proprietary meta language for creating markup languages suited for different tasks, domains, and disciplines.
---
## Quick introduction to XML: Tags
An XML markup language consists of "tags" used to define the structure and other features of a text.

### HTML
- **`<p>(paragraph of text)</p>`**
- **`<img src="buffy.jpg"/>`**
- **`<a href="http://www.indiana.edu">Indiana University</a>`**
---
## Quick introduction to XML: Tags
### TEI
- **`<sp who="#rosamond"> (speech) </sp>`**
- **`<lg> (line group, stanza) </lg>`**
- **`<salute>Dear Fred,</salute>`**
---
## XML Key Terms
-  **Elements** are the basic, named structural units of an XML document (_nouns of encoding_)
```
<title>The Odyssey</title>
```
-  **Attributes** are name/value pairs (name="value") associated with elements (_adjectives of encoding_)
```
<creator type="author">Homer</creator>
```
	-  An element may have multiple attributes
	
```
<note type="editorial" resp="#jawalsh" n="7">
	
<note type="editorial" 
      resp="#jawalsh" 
	  n="7">
```
---
## XML Key Terms
-  A **DTD** (Document Type Definition) or **schema** is a document that define the rules that govern a particular type of XML document. The DTD or schema declares elements and attributes and the allowable content for those elements and attributes (*grammar rules*)
	- DTDs are part of the original XML specification. Schemas, which offer additional functionality and more specificity than DTDs were introduced later. 
	- There are multipe options for XML schemas, including:
		- [W3C XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema)
		- [RELAX NG](https://relaxng.org)

## XML: Well-formed and valid
All XML documents need to be well-formed according to some basic rules:
- Open and close all tags/elements
- Tags/elements may not overlap
- Etc.

XML documents may optionally also be valid, meaning they follow the more specific rules of a DTD or schema:
- Use only elements and attributes specified in the DTD or schema
- Adhere to the “grammar rules” for the lexicon
 
XML parsers on their own or embedded in XML editors like Oxygen can check a document for well-formedness and validity and report errors.
---
## Well-formed XML
A well-formed document follows the basic rules of XML. Some of these rules are:
- Open and close all tags
- Empty-element tags end with /> (e.g. <pb />)
- There is a single root element
- Elements may not overlap (i.e., elements must be properly nested; i.e., an element must begin and end inside its parent):
```
<!-- This code is NOT well-formed -->
<p>Dickens wrote <title>A Tale of Two Cities.</p></title>
<!-- This code is well-formed -->
<p>Dickens wrote <title>A Tale of Two Cities</title>.</p>
```
- Attribute values are quoted (using 'single' or "double" quotes)
- **`&lt;`** and **`&amp;`** are only used to start tags and entity references

## TEI Guidelines: Quick Overview
- Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) / _Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (TEI)_
- The TEI Guidelines “are addressed to anyone who works with any text in electronic form. They provide means of representing those features of a text which need to be identified explicitly in order to facilitate processing of the text by computer programs” (Sperberg-McQueen).
- TEI provides elements, attributes, and other mechanisms for encoding prose, poetry, drama, dictionaries, critical apparatus, linguistic corpora, and other scholarly and non-scholarly texts.
---
## TEI Guidelines: Quick Overview
- Can be applied lightly or heavily (See <http://purl.org/TEI/teiinlibraries>)
- Can adapt to local conditions
- Designed as a set of modules/mechanisms that can be selected as needed:
	- core: Elements common to all TEI documents
	- figures: Tables, formulae, music notation, and figures
	- linking: Linking, segmentation, and alignment
	- msdescription: Manuscript description
	- namesdates: Names and dates
	- etc.
---
## TEI P5 _Guidelines_
- P5 Guidelines (<http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html>)
	- Prose documentation with examples
- P5 _Guidelines, Appendix C: Elements (<http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html>)
	- Reference list of all TEI elements with examples and links to prose documentation.
---
## TEI P5: Basic structural components
- **`<TEI>`**: The root element of a TEI document
	- **`<teiHeader>`**: The metadata header for a TEI document. Includes bibliographic, technical, administrative, and other metadata about the digital file and the analog source, if one exists.
	- **`<text>`**: The text itself, e.g., the title page and chapters of a novel, the acts and scenes of a drama, the books or cantos of a long poem. The **`<text>`** element is further subdivided into:
		- **`<front>`**: Front matter, e.g, the title page(s), table of contents, potentially a preface or dedication.
		- **`<body>`**: The main body of a document, excluding front and back matter.
		- **`<back>`**: Back matter, e.g., indices, appendices.
---
## TEI P5: Basic Markup: Prose
- **`<div>`**: (division) is used for basic structural divisions of a text, e.g, volumes, chapters, sections, cantos, tables of contents, indices, appendices, etc. The @type attribute may be used to designate the type of the division.
```
<div type="chapter">…</div>              
<div type="section">…</div>
<div type="contents">…</div>
<div type="canto">…</div>
```
- **`<head>`**: (heading) contains any type of heading, for example the title of a section, or the heading of a list, figure, table, etc.
- **`<p>`**: (paragraph)
- **`<pb>`**: (page break) marks the boundary between one page of a text and the next

### Chapter 1: The Manor House                
Charles hadn’t visited the manor house since Easter,1955, and now he remembered why. 

“Hullo”, he called out as he walked up the drive, and then, as if to himself, “To be or not to be?, to walk or not to walk...oh, **hang** it all!” His meditation on Hamlet was interrupted as he collided with a peacock. “Sacré bleu!” he exclaimed with irritation, his sang-froid completely deserting him. It was going to be a long week. His catalog of irritations included:  
 
1. The weather 
2.  The peacocks   
3.  His meager grasp of French

## TEI P5: Poetry

### THE ROUNDEL

A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere,  
With craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought,  
That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear  
&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;A roundel is wrought.

Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught—  
Love, laughter, or mourning—remembrance of rapture or fear—  
That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought.

As a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear  
Pause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught,  
So moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear,  
&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;A roundel is wrought.
